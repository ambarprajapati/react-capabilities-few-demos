### Demo-1:
#### Build single view app containing `nested react component hierarchy` using state, props, javascript array methods, and conditional styles

> In this demo, we create a single-view To-Do list app. The to-do list is capable of creating, deleting, updating and completing tasks. 
> 
> A task in To-do list is an object with properties: `id`, `title`, `description`, and `completed`.
> 

#### Functional Objectives:

* A user must be able to create a task.
  * A user must not be able to create a task with no title.
* A user must be able to delete a task.
* A user must be able to complete a task.
  * A user must be able to see a visual representation of a completed task.
  * The complete button should be disabled if the task is completed.
* A user must be able to see a list of all their tasks.
* The `add-task` input field must clear after adding a task.
* After adding a new task, the task must be added to the list of visible `tasks`.

#### Technical Objectives:

* Create a react app from scratch using `create-react-app`.
* Components.
* State.
* Props.
* <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map?v=example">Map</a>.
